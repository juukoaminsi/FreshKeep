    <h1>FreshKeep: Food for All!</h1>


    <p><strong>Location</strong></p>
    <p>Uganda</p>


    <h2><strong>Core Values</strong></h2>
    <p>In Uganda, one-third of all harvested food is lost before it gets to people's homes. Countrywide, this inefficiency in managing a much-needed resource has resulted in serious economic, social, and environmental impacts. Although Uganda produces a large quantity of fruits and vegetables for export, about 40% of these are lost as waste because most Ugandans cannot preserve it for long demands or meet the strict regulations. This is further compounded by food losses that occur at the farm level due to poor infrastructure and limited value addition. Statistics from the Food and Agriculture Organization show that we lose an estimated Shs. 72 billion every season to limited investment in addressing food loss. These funds could otherwise have been used to fund other public services. Another sobering statistic shows that more than 690 million people in the world still go to bed hungry, and over 3 billion people do not have regular access to enough food.</p>
    
    <h3><strong>Who is affected?</strong></h3>
 Sub-Saharan Africa contributes over a third (239 million) of the world's hungry population. Hunger and obesity form two sides of Uganda's broken food system, an imbalance that needs an urgent solution. All Ugandans are affected, including smallholder farmers who bear the brunt of food waste as they lack access to storage facilities and processing technologies, and a growing segment of Ugandan consumers that are struggling to access nutritious food. When perishable food products spoil or go unsold by traders and food vendors, financial losses ensue. Among the urban poor in Uganda, food waste exacerbates malnutrition and food insecurity. This is worse for women and children, who are usually more vulnerable to malnutrition.</p>
    
    <p><strong>How widespread is it?</strong> Food waste in Sub-Saharan Africa is rapidly rising, coinciding with a rapid population increase. It is more prominent in households than in restaurants, schools, and produce markets. Ugandan households, institutions, and produce markets reported a weekly food waste occurrence of 96%, 72%, and 93%, generating an average of 680, 80, and 8 tons of food waste daily respectively. Ugandans continue to view food waste as a serious challenge that must urgently be addressed, and view food waste as a valuable resource for producing useful things like livestock feed. In East Africa, food waste from markets accounts for 65-79% of the total biological waste in major cities.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Why is it important to solve?</strong> Reducing food waste would be a multiple win for farmers as they get to retain more of their harvest and boost their income. More people are fed per family, which directly contributes to SDG 2. Reducing food loss will also alleviate pressure on precious environmental resources (soil and water). Addressing this challenge also strongly resonates with Uganda's and global sustainable development priorities in meeting food security goals to improve livelihoods, reduce the malnutrition-related disease burden, and enhance economic competitiveness.</p>

    <h2>Solution Description</h2>
    <p>FreshKeep was designed to reduce food waste in Uganda, with plans to scale globally. It is a solar-powered, portable, and intelligent storage and drying system designed to extend food shelf life. It uses advanced sensors, microcontrollers, and other IoT technology to monitor and adjust temperature, humidity, and air quality in real-time to ensure optimal storage conditions. Each unit will have a plant-derived and edible biopolymer coating for fruits and vegetables to extend their shelf life by reducing moisture loss and slowing down the ripening process. FreshKeep is user-friendly and versatile, making it suitable for farms, businesses, and households. FreshKeep has a convertible design that seamlessly integrates both storage and drying functionalities into a single unit, durable wheels, and a secure locking mechanism that allow it to be easily and safely moved from one location to another. With a simple adjustment, the unit can be converted into a drying slate, utilizing sunlight to dehydrate fruits, vegetables, and other produce.</p>
    
    <p>FreshKeep provides versatility in food preservation with its dual functionality that will allow farmers to choose between drying and storage as needed based on the type of produce and current market demand. The produce can be preserved for longer periods, minimizing post-harvest losses and increasing market availability. The movable design improves accessibility for farmers to allow them to easily relocate the unit to areas where it is most needed, whether in fields during harvest or in marketplaces for distribution.</p>
    
    <p>FreshKeep is powered by solar energy to ensure that it remains operational in Ugandan rural areas, which are known for their unreliable electricity supply. This also makes it an appealing choice for environmentally conscious users. Users can easily switch between storage and drying modes, making FreshKeep adaptable to various agricultural products and seasonal demands. This versatility is highly attractive to Ugandan farmers, vendors, and other consumer segments. The economic benefits that FreshKeep comes with will be attractive to farmers, whose incomes will increase as a result of the extended market life of their produce. Consumers will also save more money and food henceforth. Users will be attracted to the efficiency and convenience of FreshKeep through its smart control system and mobile app interface and can easily send feedback on the user experience.</p>


   

    <h4>Progress Report</h4>
    <p>FreshKeep was conceived to tackle a pressing issue of food waste in Uganda.</strong> Recognizing the severe environmental, economic, and social impacts of food spoilage, we envisioned a sustainable solution: to create an intelligent storage and drying system. FreshKeep aims to extend the shelf life of farm produce through real-time monitoring, humidity, and temperature control, and the application of an organic formula. Our approach combines innovative technology with community engagement to create a long-lasting impact.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Steps Taken:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Research and Conceptualization:</strong> We conducted extensive research on food waste issues both locally and globally and explored various preservation methods, using our findings to conceptualize FreshKeep, an innovative system designed to meet the specific needs of Ugandan farmers, businesses, and households.</li>
        <li><strong>Team Formation:</strong> We assembled a multidisciplinary team with expertise in various fields to
